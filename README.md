# Tale-js
Tale-js is an interactive story maker, that allows you to write a story using JavaScript logic controls.

There are a few requirements:

# Documentation
Tale-js interacts with 2 page elements, an element which displays your text (markdown formatted) called #page, and the body background image (to set chapter themes).

## Formatting
Tale-js books are in JSON, with a key for each chapter/location. Because JSON doesn't allow multi-line strings, your chapters must use ```\n``` to separate lines.

The start of the book is called `index`. That's where Tale-js will begin when first opening your book file.

## functions

The advantage of Tale-js is its functions.

### Printing
Printing to the #page element is quite simple. All you do is use the ```.out()``` method on your string. Your string is processed for markdown, before being shown to the user.

### Background
Tale-js lets you set the mood for a certain chapter by changing the body background of the page you're on via ```background(url)```.

### Clear
```clear()``` clears all text in the #page element.

### Goto
You may change pages at any time with the ```goto(page)``` function. Just make sure your book actually contains the page.

### Storage
Tale-js offers direct access to storage with short functions: get and set

#### Set
```set(key, value)``` sets a key in localstorage to the given value.

#### Get
```get(key)``` returns said value.
